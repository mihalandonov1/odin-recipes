        <img src="../images/salad.jpg">
        <h2>Delicios and Healthy Salad</h2>
        <p>In this <b>Hearty Side Salad</b> that blends sea greens and land greens, fresh salad greens, carrots, radishes, and cucumber get a boost of salinity and texture from three different types of nutritious and delicious seaweeds: kelp, dulse, and Irish moss. The trio of mineral-forward sea vegetables is nicely balanced by rice vinegar dressing.</p>
