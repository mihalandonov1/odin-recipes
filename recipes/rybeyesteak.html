    <h2>The Perfect Rib Eye Steak</h2>
        <p><b>Rib Eye Steak</b> can seem intimidating to cook, but this recipe couldn't be simpler. Based on a recipe from Alain Ducasse, this rib eye steak method has essentially two parts: seasoning the meat well and letting it stand at room temperature for at least half an hour, and then cooking them in a hot cast iron skillet. Halfway through cooking, these bone-in rib eyes are basted with a mixture of butter, thyme and garlic that's already in the skillet, so they're crusty outside and richly flavored. And don't worry about any special equipment. For these ribeyes, all you need is a sturdy pan and a spoon.</p>
            <h3>Ingedients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two 1 1/4-pound, bone-in rib eye steaks</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
                    <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>1 rosemary sprig</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season the rib eye steaks all over with salt and freshly ground pepper. Let the meat stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the canola oil until shimmering. Add the steaks and cook over high heat until crusty on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn the steaks and add the butter, thyme, garlic and rosemary to the skillet. Cook over high heat, basting the steaks with the melted butter, garlic and herbs, until the steaks are medium-rare, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut the steaks off the bone, then slice the meat across the grain and serve.</li>
